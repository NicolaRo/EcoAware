# 🌱 EcoAware: CarbonPrint Calculator

Welcome to **EcoAware**!  
As part of my **Master's program**, I designed and developed a lightweight and user-friendly web application to help individuals estimate their **monthly carbon footprint** based on **energy consumption** and **vehicle travel**. 🌍💨

This educational project aims to raise awareness about personal environmental impact and demonstrate my skills in front-end development, UI design, and JavaScript logic.

## 🧠 How It Works

This app uses simple yet reliable CO₂ emission coefficients:

- **0.233 kg of CO₂ per kWh** of electricity used
- **0.21 kg of CO₂ per kilometer** driven by car

These values are multiplied by your input values to give you an estimate of your carbon output for the month.
